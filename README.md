I am going to take some real world problems and solve using AI i.e by Predictions made by my Machine Learning algorithms
#
****BreastCancerDetectionusing Logisitic regression****
Here in the detection of Breast cancer i took a dataset from the kaggle and analyzed the parameters which are responsible for the detection and classifcation into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous)
I started with the logistic regression algorithm which i imported from sklearn.linear_model
I ended up with an accuracy of  **0.631578947368421** when the training data is 20% of input data
  **Results:**
  Accuracy=0.631578947368421,training_Data=20% of input data
  Accuracy=0.7017543859649122,training_Data=30% of input data
  Accuracy=0.5964912280701754,training_Data=40% of input data
  so i can conclude that the logistic regression model can classify the given patinets record into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous) with good accuracy when the training data=30% of input data
